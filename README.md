PRESIDENTIAL GUESSING GAME!

Thank you for visiting my repository. This project is a twist on the hangman game that many played as kids.  Here’s a little information on how to play this game:

	The object of the game is to guess the name of a former or current president before running out of guesses. 

	The game begins with 20 guesses.

To play:

	The user starts the game by entering: node index.js in the Command Line Interface (CLI).

	The game randomly selects the name of a president and places underscores the length of the name on the screen (spaces are displayed and do not need to be guessed).

	If the letter is included in the name of the president, the game replaces the underscore with the letter, displays: Your guess is correct!, and decrements a guess.

	If letter is not included in the name of the president, the game displays: Try Again and decrements a guess.

	If the user guesses all letters before running out of guesses, he/she wins and the game displays: You won! The answer is: (displays the president's name)

	If the user does not guess all letters before running out of guesses, he/she loses and the game displays: You are out of guesses. The answer is: (displays the president's name)

	Upon winning or losing, the game terminates.

This project is targeted to elementary school students who are studying U.S. presidential history or to anyone who wants to test their knowledge.

Hope you enjoy the game!
